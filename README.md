# Daily Tab

A Firefox extension to automatically open tabs at a given time every day, even
if the browser is closed at the time.

You can use this as reminders for sites you want to check for updates, or to
launch sites for daily games such as Wordle.

## Installation

Either download this add-on from
[the Firefox Add-Ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org)
, or download the source code and load the add-on as a temporary add-on via
`about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.

## Usage

Open the extension configuration page via the extension icon (remember to check
the extension overflow menu if you can't see the icon), and add timers there to
set up sites to open at specific times.

On Firefox for desktop, tabs will be opened in the background, and will not load
until you click on them, so that your work is not interrupted. This
functionality is not supported on Firefox for Android however, so tabs will open
up in the foreground.
